	- Unless otherwise agreed between the ASSEMBLY manufacturer and the user, the minimum
	  cross-sectional area of the neutral within a three phase and neutral circuit shall be:
	  · For circuits with a phase conductor cross-sectional area up to and including 16 mm2,
	  100 % of that of the corresponding phases.
	  · For circuits with a phase conductor cross-sectional area above 16 mm², 50 % of that of the
	  corresponding phases with a minimum of 16 mm2.
	  It is assumed that the neutral currents do not exceed 50 % of the phase currents.
